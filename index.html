          Hi! Welcome to my web page! 
          This just exists to showcase projects I've worked on or 
          things I find interesting. In the descriptions below, feel 
          free to click on the links for more detailed explanations of
          the projects.
        </p>
        <p> 
          About me: I'm a third year undergrad studying computer science at 
          Cornell. I love programming and making things in general. 
          Academically, right now I am gaining interest in programming
          language theory. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently I went to a hackathon with my friend and we made a project
          called <a href="blog/timbreline.html">
          Timbreline</a> that lets the user invent new instruments by exploring 
          timbres. 
          <!-- I'm also working on <a href="asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf"> 
          simulations to find the best Rummy strategy</a>, 
          and I was working on an AI that plays
          Pokemon, but the latter project will have to wait until I get a long
          break. -->
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have been directed here by my resume, you may have already
          seen some of these, but here are my most important projects from
          last semester. I worked on a 
          <a href="https://sustainable-sustenance-v3.herokuapp.com/">
          sustainable recipe recommender</a>. I also made a game similar
          to
        <!-- <a href="asdfas/asdfasdfasdf"> -->
          Breakout<!--</a> -->
          in OCaml with two other students, entirely from scratch. In the same 
          class I also developed an interpreter for a language the professor
          gave us called "JoCalf" which is similar to JavaScript and OCaml. 
          This semester, I coded another interpreter for my programming
          languages class for a simple imperative language.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also make a lot of games. Beside the aforementioned
          breakout, two semesters ago I made a 
          <a href="blog/andcam.html">
            RPG revolving around chess
          </a>
          with C for my video game studies class. 
          Last summer I made a
          <a href="https://github.com/liamdaniels/JRPG_Engine">
          game engine</a>
           for a JRPG-style 
          game in Java. </p>

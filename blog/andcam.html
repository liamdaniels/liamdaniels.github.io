          This is a game I whipped up for my video game studies class back
          in December 2020. The class was about analyzing video games, not 
          coding them (it counted for my literature requirement, actually), 
          so this was made with the intention of demonstrating
          something critical and interesting. I made it from scratch in C,
          using the SDL2 library for displaying graphics and reading input.

          The game attempts to mimic Pok√©mon, but with chess replacing the
          battling. The player walks through a park, talking to NPCs who 
          discuss chess and facing off against chess opponents. Here is a 
          picture of me talking to one such opponent in the game:

          I gave the opponents distinctive "chess personalities" that come out
          in their AI. For example, this opponent, who asks the player not to
          take their pieces, moves such that no pieces are in danger and
          considers nothing else. 
          Here is a picture of a game against them several moves in, where they
          have moved their rook back and forth to avoid its capture, not caring
          about the impending checkmate on f7.

          The critical aim in making this game was to see how it would feel to
          play a game where the player has to absorb new information, but with
          characters that were connotationally "cold;" the chess pieces. In
          Pokemon, for example, the player absorbs information on the type
          system, the Pokemons' stats, et cetera, but I suspected that the 
          fact that the Pokemon are cute characters makes learning this 
          information more appealing. Of course, one difference here is that 
          most information in this game is "meta" information about chess 
          strategy and tactics. Some characters do explain the rules of the
          game, though, like castling and how the knight moves.

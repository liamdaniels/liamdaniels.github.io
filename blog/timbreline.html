          Timbreline is an app for finding new electronic instruments. I made
          this with two others at the Big Red Hacks hackathon at Cornell back
          in late September. The theme for the hackathon was "exploration,"
          so we decided to be a bit outside the box by exploring the space 
          of sound.

          In the above image, the dots represent different timbres. Timbre 
          (pronounced "tamber") is the part of sound that differentiates 
          the sound of, say, a piano from a guitar. We used three different
          dimensions of timbre, which were represented in the color of the 
          dots by red, green, and blue. They're all fairly complicated, but
          essentially blue was piano/violin-type instruments, green was 
          flute-like, and red was more of a bluegrass/microphone feedback
          type of sound. The user, upon selecting a dot, can click forward
          to see new dots which are more similar to the one they chose, 
          until they are too similar and we converge upon one instrument.
          The user can also play the piano at the bottom to test out the 
          timbre they've selected, of course.
        </p>

          The majority of the work was from me and my friend Thomas (our third
          group member was just getting into programming and preferred to
          sit back; we did not ostracise him). Thomas worked on the 
          timbre part, which essentially consisted of finding a way to turn
          a vector into a waveform representing a timbre. I developed the 
          entire interface, and also the exploration algorithm along with
          Thomas. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I'm proud of what we made! I think the interface is
          intuitive and the concept is original. The code also looks
          pretty good for hackathon standards.
